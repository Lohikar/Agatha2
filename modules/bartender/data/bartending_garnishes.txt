with a sprig of parsley
with a radioactive fuel rod in it
with a tiny paper umbrella and a tiny swimsuit-wearing Mary Poppins
with a sprig of belladonna
with a sheep rib on top
with a sprig of parsley
on fire
cooled to absolute zero
with a diona nymph floating in it
served at room temperature
with an Orokin cell in it
with an Orokin catalyst in it
with an Orokin reactor in it
(but it will be building in the Foundry for 72 hours)
dosed with enough tranquilizer to knock out an elephant
with a little paper umbrella
and Coke
that she had just gargled and spit back out
on the rocks
(I promise it's not poison)
and Love Potion No. 9

(0.5% ABV)
(120% ABV)

and a slice of lemon
and a slice of... some sort of unidentifiable citrus fruit
shaken, not stirred
and too many olives
decorated with a tiny hamburger, an onion ring, a pickled egg, and a slice of bacon
served cold, the air and water flowing,
served tepid, a la fountain d'Nethack
filled with the lamentations of their women
topped with McWhorter's Original Condiment
sprinkled with cigarette butts
blended with a certain je ne se quoi
and a liberal application of Saunt Loy's Powder
sprinkled copiously with eyelashes
with a tiny paper umbrella and a tiny swimsuit-wearing Mary Poppins
- which is loaded into a gun like a battery -
which by the end of the night you well expect to end up puked into either a gutter, toilet, sink, bush, or taxi upholstery
placed in a nice floral arrangement
and a tiny Carl Jung
and an imaginary remainder
and someone's prosthetic eye
and a diamond engagement ring
and a big black dildo
with real buffalo wings from a real winged buffalo
and a sprig of horseradish
containing an entire deck of cards
served [REDACTED]
with a whisky depth charge
and Irish cream
with a Tabasco depth charge
with a healthy topper of whipped cream
with a JÃ¤germeister depth charge
, to the delight of screaming Tenno, begging for THEIR LIVES
